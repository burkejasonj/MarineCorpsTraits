🪖 Marine Corps Genetics
Supersoldier Gene & Trait Framework for RimWorld

Marine Corps Genetics introduces a scalable supersoldier progression system using three custom genes and three matching traits. Each specialization — Corpsman, Marine, and War Hero — rewrites a pawn into an optimized battlefield role with powerful but balanced enhancements.
Unlike godmode mods (e.g. Apotheosis), this mod delivers lore-friendly, progressive, and sanity-preserving superhuman tiers with clean XML and C# hybrid behavior.

📦 Features
🔥 Three Complete Gene Templates

Each gene:

Removes any pre-existing Marine/Corpsman/WarHero traits
Applies the correct specialization trait
Sets associated skills to the correct levels
Runs automatically even in old saves (retroactive support)

💪 Three Scaled Supersoldier Traits

Balanced tiers based on role:
Tier	Focus	Summary
Corpsman	Medic/Survival	Fast healer, strong immunity, 2× work/move/learn, extreme environment tolerance
Marine	Frontline Assault	High combat stats, strong armor, 3× work/move/learn, heavy carry capacity
War Hero	Endgame Apex	Insane work/learn/move, extreme tanking, max toxin immunity, perfect soldier template

🧬 Skill Templates (C#)

Corpsman: Cooking/Plants/Animals/Medical 20, rest 10
Marine: Shooting/Construction/Melee/Mining/Crafting 20, rest 10
War Hero: All skills 20

🔥 Environmental Hardening

All three tiers:
Comfy temperature: -100°C → +200°C
Fully mental-break immune
Reduced hunger rate
Scaled toxin resistance
Scaled healing via InjuryHealingFactor

⚙ Retroactive Behavior

Install anytime — all pawns with these genes auto-update the moment you load your save.

❓ FAQ
Q: Can pawns inherit these genes?
No. These are xenogenes only for balance and control.

Q: Will this break existing saves?
No — it automatically updates pawns when loaded.

Q: Is this overpowered?
Yes — intentionally.
But it’s scaled, predictable, and lore-friendly, not instant godmode.
